                Growing up is madness
                Raised to pass through a simple land cultivated and green Living beyond struggles like an artist painting his dream
                The child never distinguished dreams from reality
                So growing up was the greatest nightmare to his sanity
                Taking steps,in a pattern not anywhere close to normal Response from everyone said he was in order
                Everything done was worth a celebration
                Living a lie full of credits,a merit Verification for being bold, bold enough to boast of a lie
                Cause growing up was really a fallacy
                And society thought him an ignorant philosophy Stripping off his uniqueness
                Calling his being truthful weakness
                What made it wrong to be a child?Why cant he follow his heart desire? Is the question that he asks
                Everything he truly wishes for,even when seen to still be blur were called risky 
                What place him so far from a child that he shouldn’t be taught the path of innocence
                when really he’s guilty Holding on to precious nothing because he was told its a duty
                And programmed like a mindless Zombie he grew to be a man
                A man that is a stranger to the boy he was
                A man who is only made up of flaws
                Is this why humanity can’t be perfect ?He is puzzled by life, cause growing up is madness

        <pre>
            I have to be strong right? Searching for my souls in this long nights
            Haunted by fear of normality Stigmatized myself, this is insanity
            I don’t understand me, yet i hate being misunderstood.

        <pre>
I don’t fit in
Nights i cry, with pains I’m reminded of the hell i live in
Always feeling alienated
I always feel I’m a broken angel
These twisted spine reminds me of my fall
Am i really made in the image of God?

God is love and love heals all
I want to believe His love for me is so much
Love is warm, so intense that His burn
I’m reminded of these pain every time I’m awake
Every time he approaches, i hide in shame
Can i be perfect without my wings?
Can i really experience love for all it is?

I just want to fly again
The nights are gleam, i awake to the light dimmed
Feels like a life time ago were i soared the sky
This is my story, this my struggle, this is my pain
Every time i awake, every time my back ache i struggle
Struggle to love myself, struggle to see beyond this flaws
With spines a fossil of where my wings once lived
In pains in tears i cry when
I remember who i was, an angel in all her glory
Give me back my wings.
